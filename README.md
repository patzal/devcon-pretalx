# Known issues

- UI is quick and dirty, the top of the table is ugly on smaller screens
- routing was not added, running out of time, hence the back button on the detailed view
- caching is done with localstorage, other strategies might fit better
- some general code quality issues, like code reuse & usage of constants, etc.
- only realized on the deployed site, but sometimes there might be 2 headers
